# FFXIV_ACT_Plugin_CN

This is a modified version of FFXIV_ACT_Plugin to adapt FFXIV Chinese client.

## About

This version of FFXIV_ACT_Plugin changed all resource names (like skills, abilities, buffs, regions, etc.) to Chinese, and it can automatically find the process of FFXIV Chinese client (it can find the process of both FFXIV Chinese client & FFXIV international client now). It can also include other modifications like memory offsets, etc. to better support FFXIV Chinese client.

More details about FFXIV_ACT_Plugin please referrer to [https://github.com/ravahn/FFXIV_ACT_Plugin](https://github.com/ravahn/FFXIV_ACT_Plugin).

__NOTES__

* This version is only meant to support current FFXIV Chinese client version (mostly it is about half a year behind the global client version).
* This version is meant to be loaded on the original Advanced Combat Tracker. Do not use it on modified versions of ACT.

The procedure is exactly the same with the original version.
